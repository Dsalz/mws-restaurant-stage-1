## About
 This is a mobile friendly restaurants review site coded by me as part of the projects in the front-end nanodegree program at udacity.
 
## How to Run
Can be cloned from this repository and run on a local server like the python server. Just load up the index.html page to get started.

Can also be viewed online here http://damola.cf/mws-restaurant-stage-1/

## Dependencies
Project is dependent on Leaflet and Map box to render the maps.
